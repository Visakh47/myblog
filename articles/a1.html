    <p><span class="post-intro">2020. Truly a year that none of us can ever really forget,</span> I need not mention the events that had rendered everyone mute throughout the course of the year & as a result of the limited social interaction the year entailed , I realized that I needed an outlet to share my thoughts more frequently and in light of the covid situation, the only way to do that is virtually. So Here goes.  </p>
    
  
    <h2>About Myself</h2>
    <p>My name is Visakh Bobby , I’m currently an engineering graduate student studying in Marian Engineering College ,Trivandrum , Kerala, India. If you haven’t heard of this college , I really can’t blame you as such because I myself heard it at the very last moment during my admission stance.  </p>
    <p>Coming to my interests , I will be downright honest here, I am a very profound tech geek. Very much so ,I love reading books and watching engaging tv shows and movies & as such my blog will be focused on tech products , movies , tv-shows & book reviews. </p>
    
    <h3>Why I Started This Blog ?</h3>
    <p>I have always had an affinity towards creative writing and recently I have realized the need for it as my linguistic skills have taken a debasement which acts as a precipitance and driving reason as to why I started this blog. So please do forgive me if I make a mistake and if possible – do help me by showing me the right way !</p>

    console.log("Good to go, chief.");
  });</pre></code>

    <h4>What I Look Forward To..</h4>
    <p> Although some people might look down on me on disapprobation for wasting my time, I intend to prove them wrong.  </p>
    <p>I’m very excited and at the same time in solicitude when I begin this new journey. I hope you all will be captivated by my forthcoming laconic blogs – I will be writing a review on the TV Show “The Falcon & The Winter Soldier” the next time I see you !
